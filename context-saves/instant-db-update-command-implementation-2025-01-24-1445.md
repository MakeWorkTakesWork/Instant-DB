# Instant-DB Update Command Implementation Session

**Date**: 2025-01-24
**Time**: 14:45 PST
**Subject**: Implementation of instant-db update command for incremental document updates
**Project**: Instant-DB (https://github.com/MakeWorkTakesWork/Instant-DB)

## Session Summary

This session focused on implementing the `instant-db update` command, which was identified as a high-priority improvement in CLAUDE.md. The command enables incremental updates to the document database by detecting and processing only changed files.

## Initial Context

- Previous session (2025-01-23) had fixed critical metadata issues and discovered MCP limitations
- CLI had a config parameter bug that was preventing proper usage
- The `instant-db update` command was listed as a needed improvement for incremental updates

## Key Accomplishments

### 1. Fixed CLI Config Issue
- **Problem**: Click decorator had naming mismatch between `--config` parameter and function argument
- **Solution**: Added explicit parameter name mapping: `@click.option('--config', '-c', 'config_path', ...)`
- **Additional Fix**: Renamed `config` command function to `configure` to avoid naming conflict with global variable

### 2. Implemented Update Command Infrastructure

#### Added to InstantDB class (`database.py`):
```python
def update_document(self, document_id: str, content: str, metadata: Dict[str, Any]) -> Dict[str, Any]:
    """Update an existing document by re-processing it"""
    # Hash-based change detection
    # Delete old document and add updated version
    # Returns update status with old/new hashes

def check_for_updates(self, source_directory: Path) -> Dict[str, Any]:
    """Check for documents that need updating based on file changes"""
    # Scans directory and compares with database
    # Returns dict with new_files, modified_files, deleted_files
```

#### Added to SearchEngine and vector stores (`search.py`):
```python
def delete_document(self, document_id: str) -> bool:
    """Delete a document from the search index"""
    # Implemented for ChromaDB, FAISS, and SQLite stores
    # Removes all chunks associated with document_id
```

### 3. Created Comprehensive CLI Update Command

Features implemented:
- **Change Detection**: Automatically detects new, modified, and deleted files
- **Dry-run Mode** (`--dry-run`): Preview changes without modifying database
- **Force Mode** (`--force`): Re-process all files regardless of changes  
- **Delete Missing** (`--delete-missing`): Optional removal of documents whose source files are gone
- **Progress Tracking**: Real-time progress bars with tqdm
- **Detailed Reporting**: Summary of changes before and after processing
- **Hash-based Detection**: MD5 hashes ensure only changed files are processed

Usage examples:
```bash
instant-db update ./documents              # Update changed files
instant-db update ./documents --dry-run    # Preview changes
instant-db update ./documents --delete-missing  # Also remove deleted files
instant-db update ./documents --force      # Force re-process all files
```

## Technical Implementation Details

### File Change Detection
- Stores MD5 hash of file content in metadata database
- Compares current file hash with stored hash
- Tracks source_file path for each document

### Update Process Flow
1. Scan directory for all processable documents
2. Compare with database to identify:
   - New files (not in database)
   - Modified files (different hash)
   - Deleted files (in database but not on disk)
3. Show summary and get user confirmation
4. Process updates:
   - Add new files using existing document processor
   - Update modified files by deleting and re-adding
   - Optionally delete missing files

### Error Handling
- Graceful handling of file read errors
- Detailed error reporting with counts
- Transaction-like behavior (delete old before adding new)

## Code Changes Summary

1. **instant_db/core/database.py**:
   - Added `update_document()` method
   - Added `check_for_updates()` method
   - Enhanced metadata tracking with file hashes

2. **instant_db/core/search.py**:
   - Added abstract `delete_document()` to BaseVectorStore
   - Implemented `delete_document()` for all vector stores
   - Added `delete_document()` to SearchEngine class

3. **instant_db/cli.py**:
   - Fixed config parameter decorator issue
   - Renamed config command to avoid naming conflict
   - Added comprehensive `update` command with all features

## Commits Made

1. **Fix CLI config parameter issue**:
   - Fixed Click decorator naming mismatch
   - Renamed config command function to 'configure'

2. **Add instant-db update command for incremental updates**:
   - Complete implementation of update functionality
   - Added delete support to all vector stores
   - Comprehensive CLI command with progress tracking

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Basic Update Flow**:
   ```bash
   # Process initial documents
   instant-db process ./test-docs
   
   # Modify a file
   echo "Updated content" >> ./test-docs/file1.txt
   
   # Check updates
   instant-db update ./test-docs --dry-run
   
   # Apply updates
   instant-db update ./test-docs
   ```

2. **Delete Detection**:
   ```bash
   # Remove a file
   rm ./test-docs/file2.txt
   
   # Update with deletion
   instant-db update ./test-docs --delete-missing
   ```

3. **Force Re-processing**:
   ```bash
   # Force update all files
   instant-db update ./test-docs --force
   ```

## Next Steps

From CLAUDE.md, the remaining improvement tasks are:
1. Create terminal recording GIF for README (low priority)
2. Create video walkthrough tutorial (low priority)

The core functionality improvements are now complete. The update command significantly improves the usability of Instant-DB for maintaining document databases over time.

## Important Notes for Future Sessions

1. **Hash Storage**: File hashes are stored in the SQLite metadata database, not in the vector stores
2. **Delete Implementation**: FAISS delete is simplified - in production, would need to store embeddings for proper index rebuild
3. **Source File Tracking**: The system relies on storing the original source_file path in metadata
4. **Atomic Updates**: Updates delete the old document before adding the new version to maintain consistency

## Session Metrics
- Duration: ~45 minutes
- Files modified: 3
- Lines added: ~405
- New functionality: Complete incremental update system
- Bugs fixed: 1 (CLI config issue)
